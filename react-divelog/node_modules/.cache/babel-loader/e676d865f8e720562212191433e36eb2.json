I am a programmer by profession. This website was entirely created by me and was created as a result of joining my two passions - diving and programming. My idea was to create something that will allow to make diving acquaintances from one place and combine all functionalities into one whole. No matter where you are, now you only need internet access and you can confidently exchange your experiences and memories. You can read what functionalities Divelog has on the main page of the application. In addition to programming and diving, I still find time to study.
